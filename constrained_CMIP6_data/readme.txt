Warming trends and anomalies for 2021-2040, using a constraint based on the observed warming trend for 1981-2017 (based on Tokarska et al., Sci Adv. 2020: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz9549). Trends and anomalies are calculated from CMIP6 GSAT data for the future emissions scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. See Tokarska et al. 2020 for further details on the CMIP6 and observational data used. Data are provided both as a raw text file, and in a form for use with the relevant Python code provided.
