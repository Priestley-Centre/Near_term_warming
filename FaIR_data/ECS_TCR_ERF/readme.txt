Distributions of ECS, TCR, and ERF, used to generate each set of 500 simulations. Also contains time-series of the ERF, both for its total and for individual forcing agents. Both versions of the aerosol ERF time-series are given (the default CMIP6 aerosol ERF and the aerosol ERF from AR5).


In detail, each file contains:

'parameters.csv' - 500 values of ECS and TCR, and 500 scaling factors to apply to the ERF time series for each component. Also contains 500 values of parameters used to account for uncertainty in the carbon cycle response (the pre-industrial sensitivity of land and ocean carbon sinks, r0; and the sensitivity of these sinks to cumulative CO2 emissions, rC; and to the temperature change since pre-industrial, rT). While this carbon cycle uncertainty is included, it has very little effect on the distributions of near-term temperature trends in FaIR (in agreement with Smith et al. 2019; see Fig 4 in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07999-w)
