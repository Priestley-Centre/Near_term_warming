Time-series of concentrations of all GHGs and SLCFs for each emissions scenario. All units are ppt except for CO2, CH4, and N20 (units given in file).

Two types of file are included:

'conc_*.csv'
- a single time-series for each GHG/SLCF. For CO2, this is for typical CO2 concentrations (see below). 

'*_concCO2.csv'
- time-series of CO2 concentrations for all 500 ensemble members in each scenario. Variation in CO2 concentrations is caused by including uncertainty in carbon cycle parameters. The non-CO2 concentrations do not vary between ensemble members.
