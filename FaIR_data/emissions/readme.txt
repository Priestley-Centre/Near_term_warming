Time-series of emissions for each emissions scenario; the SSP datasets were obtained from https://www.rcmip.org/ and the NDCs dataset was provided by Joeri Rogelj. The NDC-like scenario is representative of the scenarios described in Chapter 3 of the UNEP Emissions Gap Report (https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/30797/EGR2019.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), and also of the pathways for the NDC-like projections in Vrontisi et al. 2018 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aab53e/pdf). Units are given for all major GHGs and SLCFs, and for minor GHGs the unit is kilotons/year.
