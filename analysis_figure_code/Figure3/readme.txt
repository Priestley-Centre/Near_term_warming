Code to produce Figure 3.

Run 'output_*.py' functions first to output data required to plot Figure 3.

'output_Ny_max_obs_trends.py' - outputs maximum trends in GSAT for a range of N-year periods in observational historical record
                                
'output_Haustein_GSAT_residuals_Nytrends_pdf_HadOST.py' - outputs time series of N-year trends in GSAT residuals for HadOST observations minus the forced IRM response in Haustein et al. (2019). To run will need to request raw data from Karsten Haustein, but processed data is provided to allow Figure 3 to still be plotted.
