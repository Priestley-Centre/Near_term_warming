Also outputs internal variability in 20-year GSAT anomalies and trends, based on Haustein et al. (2019), for plotting Figure 1 and various other similar figures showing FaIR data plus IV. 

To run will need to request raw data from Karsten Haustein, but processed data is provided in Priestley-Centre/Near_term_warming/IV_data/ to allow relevant figures to still be plotted.
