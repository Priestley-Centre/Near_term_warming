# Note

The data and code in this repository relates to the following paper in review:

McKenna C. M., A. C. Maycock, P. M. Forster, C. J. Smith, K. B. Tokarska, Stringent mitigation substantially reduces risk of unprecedented near-term warming rates, Nature Climate Change, in review.

The data was processed with funding from the European Unionâ€™s CONSTRAIN project as part of the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement number 820829.


# FaIR data

## Temperature
Time-series of annual global surface air temperature (GSAT) anomalies for 500 FaIR simple model simulations using historical emissions and future emissions scenarios (NDCs, SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). Anomalies are calculated with respect to 1850-1900. The 500 simulations were generated from a broad uncertainty analysis of possible futures, based on lines of evidence for ECS, TCR, and ERF that reflect our latest understanding since IPCC SR1.5. Files listed use two different time-series of aerosol ERF: the default CMIP6 aerosol ERF, or the aerosol ERF from AR5.


# Constrained CMIP6 data

Warming trends and anomalies for 2021-2040, using a constraint based on the observed warming trend for 1981-2017 (based on Tokarska et al., Sci Adv. 2020: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz9549). Trends and anomalies are calculated from CMIP6 GSAT data for the future emissions scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. See Tokarska et al. 2020 for further details on the CMIP6 and observational data used. 


# Observation-based data

Time-series of annual global mean surface temperature from different observational datasets, which are used to calculate observed temperature trends over the historical period. Datasets were downloaded from the following links:
