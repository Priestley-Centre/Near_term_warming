# Note

The data in this repository relates to the following paper in review:

McKenna C. M., A. C. Maycock, P. M. Forster, C. J. Smith, K. B. Tokarska, Stringent mitigation substantially reduces risk of unprecendented near-term warming rates, Nature Climate Change, in review.

The data was processed with funding from the European Unionâ€™s CONSTRAIN project as part of the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement number 820829.


# FaIR GSAT data

Time-series of annual GSAT anomalies for 500 FaIR simple model simulations using historical emissions and future emissions scenarios (NDCs, SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). Anomalies are calculated with respect to 1850-1900. The 500 simulations were generated from a broad uncertainty analysis of possible futures, based on lines of evidence for ECS, TCR, and ERF that reflect our latest understanding since IPCC SR1.5. Files listed use two different time-series of aerosol ERF: the default CMIP6 aerosol ERF, or the aerosol ERF from AR5.
