If running 'run_FaIR_simulations.ipynb', the FaIR simulation data will be output into this 'data_out' folder. For clarity here, the data for the emissions scenarios used in the paper have instead been organised into folders with descriptions in 'Priestley-Centre/Near_term_warming/FaIR_data/'. Data for additional scenarios are provided here for completeness.
